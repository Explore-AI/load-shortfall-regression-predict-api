"""

    Helper functions for the pretrained model to be used within our API.

    Author: Explore Data Science Academy.

    Note:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Please follow the instructions provided within the README.md file
    located within this directory for guidance on how to use this script
    correctly.

    Importantly, you will need to modify this file by adding
    your own data preprocessing steps within the `_preprocess_data()`
    function.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Description: This file contains several functions used to abstract aspects
    of model interaction within the API. This includes loading a model from
    file, data preprocessing, and model prediction.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The data payload received within POST requests sent to our API.

    Returns
    -------
    Pandas DataFrame : <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
