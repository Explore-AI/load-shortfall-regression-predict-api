# Power Analytics - Regression Model for Energy Shortfall Prediction


## Project Overview

Power Analytics is a data science company hired by the government of Spain to provide solutions using regression models for their energy-related challenges. The focus of the project is to analyze and predict the daily energy shortfall in Spain, considering both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources.

### Problem Statement

The supply of electricity is crucial for the well-being of citizens, and there is a growing need to balance the use of non-renewable and renewable energy sources. The government of Spain is keen on expanding its renewable energy infrastructure and requires insights into the trends and patterns of energy generation.


### Data

The project utilizes a dataset stored in the 'train.csv' document, containing information such as time, weather features (wind speed, humidity, etc.), and energy-related variables (load shortfall). The goal is to model the daily energy shortfall as a function of various city-specific weather features.
