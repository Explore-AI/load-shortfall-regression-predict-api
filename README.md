Power Analytics - Regression Model for Energy Shortfall Prediction
Project Overview
Power Analytics is a data science company hired by the government of Spain to provide solutions using regression models for their energy-related challenges. The focus of the project is to analyze and predict the daily energy shortfall in Spain, considering both fossil fuel and renewable energy sources.

Problem Statement
The supply of electricity is crucial for the well-being of citizens, and there is a growing need to balance the use of non-renewable and renewable energy sources. The government of Spain is keen on expanding its renewable energy infrastructure and requires insights into the trends and patterns of energy generation.

Data
The project utilizes a dataset stored in the 'train.csv' document, containing information such as time, weather features (wind speed, humidity, etc.), and energy-related variables (load shortfall). The goal is to model the daily energy shortfall as a function of various city-specific weather features.
